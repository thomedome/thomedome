# Hey! 🫶
I'm Tom (a.k.a thomedome) - A Game Design student focused on learning what makes games tick (pun intended.) <br>
Currently learning C++ through small projects, hoping to move to larger projects later down the line. <br><br>
Before deciding to learn C++, I worked in **Roblox Studio** on and off for a few years, experimenting with scripting, game mechanics and design as a passion project. <br><br>
Since then, I completed a **Level 3 Extended Diploma in App Development (D\*DD)** - focusing on programming, software design, and real-world development projects that pushed me toward game programming.

## Current Projects ✅
- [RPGProject](https://github.com/thomedome/RPGProject) - CLI-Based RPG, with combat, items and saving. *v1.0 released!*
